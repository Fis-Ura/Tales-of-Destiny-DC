<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
<center>This is the Swordian Team.
Proceeding to take Mikheil.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Ritora>
[ENDBLOCK]
Affirmative.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
So this is where the Aetherian Army
had their troops stationed...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
<center>That's right. Come on, let's
find the Aeth'er Cruiser.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Something's been bugging me.
Why did you leave these areas
intact?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
If you had just destroyed them,
we wouldn't be in this mess.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Atwight>
[ENDBLOCK]
<center>We certainly considered that course
of action after the last Aeth'er Wars.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Clemente>
[ENDBLOCK]
<center>Destroying them would negatively
impact the environment. We decided
instead to sink them into the ocean.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
So, after the final battle, we'll have
to disable them once and for all.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
<center>I never thought I'd hear you 
utter such a statement.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
What, is that weird?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
<center>No, just decisive. I'm impressed.
That is the right course of action.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
We have to put an end to
<Hugo>'s plan before we
can accomplish that.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Right!

<TAG_007>[Titles Description]
Titles are one of the character
parameters that can be set. 
The specific method is as follows.
[ENDBLOCK]
Notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>After opening the main menu,
the character status will display.
On this screen, press <Square_ani> to 
change the character status.

[ENDBLOCK]
Notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>At the top of this screen will be
[Titles]. Press <Triangle_ani> to pick from
all acquired titles.

[ENDBLOCK]
Notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>Titles serve two purposes:
The first is to [affect dialogue 
when talking to NPCs].
[ENDBLOCK]
Notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>Set a title to have certain NPCs interested
while passing them. When talking with NPCs
multiple times you may get different responses.
Change the title and try talking to them again.
[ENDBLOCK]
Notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>Hint: When talking to certain NPCs, a [?] will 
appear over the character's head. If this 
happens, set a title that seems to be related
to the dialogue, and try talking to them again.
Something fun may happen.
[ENDBLOCK]
Notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>The second purpose for titles is...
to make your status screen look cool!
When collecting titles, you might pick
up one you like, so you can set it on
your status for a little flair!
[ENDBLOCK]
Notice
[ENDBLOCK]
